# Hummingbird for Linux and macOS

#### AirVPN's free and open source OpenVPN 3 client based on AirVPN's OpenVPN 3 library fork

### Version 1.0 - Release date 27 December 2019


## Note on Checksum Files

Hummingbird is an open source project and, as such, its source code can be
downloaded, forked and modified by anyone who wants to create a derivative
project or build it on his or her computer. This also means the source code can
be tampered or modified in a malicious way, therefore creating a binary version
of hummingbird which may act harmfully, destroy or steal your data, redirecting
your network traffic and data while pretending to be the "real" hummingbird
client genuinely developed and supported by AirVPN.

For this reason, we cannot guarantee forked, modified and custom compiled
versions of Hummingbird to be compliant to our specifications, development and
coding guidelines and style, including our security standards. These derivative
projects, of course, may also be better and more efficient than our release,
however we cannot guarantee or provide help for the job or others.

You are therefore strongly advised to check and verify the checksum codes found
in the .sha512 files to exactly correspond to the ones below, that is, the
checksum we have computed from the sources and distribution files directly
compiled and built by AirVPN. This will make you sure about the origin and
authenticity of hummingbird client. Please note the files contained in the
distribution tarballs are created from the very source code available the master
branch of the [official hummingbird's repository](https://gitlab.com/AirVPN/hummingbird).
